AI Solution - Relevance to the theme
The proposed ai stroke shield solution aligns with the theme of using artificial intelligence 
to improve healthcare within local communities. It applies machine learning to predict the 
likelihood of stroke based on medical and lifestyle data such as age, bmi, glucose levels and 
smoking habits. The system addresses challenges faced in many south african clinics where 
early diagnosis tools are limited, offering a proactive, data-driven method to identify high
risk patients before symptoms occur. By supporting early detection, efficient decision
making, and better resource allocation, the ai stroke shield solution enhances healthcare 
accessibility and directly contributes to improved community wellbeing making it both
relevant and impactful to the theme and environment described in the project brief. 


Problem defination

Stroke remains one of the most serious public health challanges in South Africa, particularly 
in local communities where earlt medical screening and diagnostic technologies are limited.
Many clinics rely on manual diagnosis and visible symptoms, which are often detected only after 
a stroke occured. This late detection leads to preventable deaths, disabilities, and increased healthcare 
costs. There is currently no affordable or accessible system that can automatically analyze
patient health data to predict stroke risk before an emergency occurs. Healthcare professionals 
also face difficulties in interpreting large amount of data such as blood pressure, bmi, age, glucose 
level quickly and accurately. As a result, many are at risk individuals remain undentified until it is too late
Therefore, the core problem is the lack of a proactive, data-driven prediction system that can
assist medical practitioners in earlt stroke detection and prevention.

The AI stroke shield system will fix this problem by using artificial intelligence to predict
stroke risk early through automated analysis of patient health data. This helps clinics identify
high-risk individuals before symptoms appear. For local municipalities, the system supports
better healthcare planning, reduces hospital admissions and saves costs. It also promotes community
health awareness and enables preventive action, improving overall, public health outcomes and service
efficiency.
