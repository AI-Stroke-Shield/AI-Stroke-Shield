AI Solution - Relevance to the theme

The proposed ai stroke shield solution aligns with the theme of using artificial intelligence 
to improve healthcare within local communities. It applies machine learning to predict the 
likelihood of stroke based on medical and lifestyle data such as age, bmi, glucose levels and 
smoking habits. The system addresses challenges faced in many south african clinics where 
early diagnosis tools are limited, offering a proactive, data-driven method to identify high
risk patients before symptoms occur. By supporting early detection, efficient decision
making, and better resource allocation, the ai stroke shield solution enhances healthcare 
accessibility and directly contributes to improved community wellbeing making it both
relevant and impactful to the theme and environment described in the project brief. 


Problem Defination

Stroke remains one of the most serious public health challanges in South Africa, particularly 
in local communities where earlt medical screening and diagnostic technologies are limited.
Many clinics rely on manual diagnosis and visible symptoms, which are often detected only after 
a stroke occured. This late detection leads to preventable deaths, disabilities, and increased healthcare 
costs. There is currently no affordable or accessible system that can automatically analyze
patient health data to predict stroke risk before an emergency occurs. Healthcare professionals 
also face difficulties in interpreting large amount of data such as blood pressure, bmi, age, glucose 
level quickly and accurately. As a result, many are at risk individuals remain undentified until it is too late
Therefore, the core problem is the lack of a proactive, data-driven prediction system that can
assist medical practitioners in earlt stroke detection and prevention.

The AI stroke shield system will fix this problem by using artificial intelligence to predict
stroke risk early through automated analysis of patient health data. This helps clinics identify
high-risk individuals before symptoms appear. For local municipalities, the system supports
better healthcare planning, reduces hospital admissions and saves costs. It also promotes community
health awareness and enables preventive action, improving overall, public health outcomes and service
efficiency.

Model and Time Series Analysis on Data

Our AI Stroke Shield model uses the XGBoost classifier, a supervised machine
learning algorithm trained on the stroke dataset where 80% of the data is used for 
training and 20% for testing. During training, the model learns relationships between
input features such as age, BMI, glucose level, and smoking status to predict the 
likelihood of a stroke. To test and evaluate performance, we used key accuracy 
measures including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. 
These metrics help check how correctly the model predicts stroke cases and how well it 
identifies true positives. Visual tools like the Confusion Matrix, ROC curve, and feature 
importance plot are also used to confirm that the model performs reliably and identifies 
the most influential health factors. 

Although the dataset is static, our project includes a plan for time series analysis to improve
Prediction Accuracy. In real healthcare, factors such as Glucose levels and BMI change over time;
by analyzing these trends, the system could forecast stroke risk earlier. For example, using ARIMA 
or LSTM, we could study monthly health data to detect gradual changes that may lead to a stroke. 
This approach would shift the model from a one-time prediction to continuous monitoring, making it
 more proactive and valuable for community health systems.

Deep Learning
For future enhancement of the ai stroke shield system, we plan to implement deep learning approaches 
to improve predictive accuracy and expand diagnostic capabilities. Specifically, we will develop 
neural network models that can identify complex, non-linear patterns in patient data that traditional 
machine learning algorithms might miss. This includes using:
•	Deep Neural Networks with multiple hidden layers to analyze comprehensive health parameters
•	Convolutional Neural Networks for processing medical imaging data such as CT scan or MRI images to 
    detect early stroke indicators
•	Recurrent Neural Networks for analyzing sequential health data over time

These deep learning techniques are highly appropriate for healthcare applications as they can handle 
complex data relationships and improve early detection capabilities. The integration of deep learning 
would transform the system from a risk prediction tool into a comprehensive diagnostic assistant, better
 aligning with the project's theme of leveraging advanced ai for healthcare improvement. 

Machine learning Approach

The AI stroke shield system uses the xgboost algorithm, a gradient-boosted tree model designed for fast 
and accurate classification. This algorithm was selected because it works effectively with medical tabular
data and captures complex interactions between a patient features such as age, glucose level, BMI and 
blood pressure. The model was trained using xgbclassifier with an 80/20 split and deployed via stream 
machine learning allowing users to make live predictions from new patient inputs. Evaluation metrics 
(accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score) confirmed that xgboost achieved strong predictive performance and 
is well suited for stoke risk detection.

Data

To teach the AI Stroke Shield how to spot potential strokes, we fed it a rich collection of real patient health records. This information included all sorts of relevant details, from straightforward numbers like a person's age, glucose levels, and BMI, to personal information such as their smoking habits, type of work, and whether they live in an urban or rural area. Before the computer could learn from this data, we had to tidy it up. For example, if a patient's BMI was missing, we plugged in a typical average value. We also converted all text-based categories, such as "smoking status," into numerical codes that the algorithm could understand. 
A key challenge was that the data had very few examples of actual strokes compared to non-strokes. To make sure our model learned to spot the real signs of risk, not just a "no stroke" guess every time, we balanced the dataset. After all this careful preparation, the data was clean, balanced, and ready. This solid foundation enabled our XGBoost model to learn effectively and accurately identify subtle patterns indicative of a high stroke risk.

Solution Techniques

Several appropriate techniques were used to ensure high model accuracy and reliability:
Machine learning algorithms: use supervised learning models such as a random forest classifier and XGBoost to predict stroke risk from medical and lifestyle data.

Data preprocessing: handled missing BMI values and encoded categorical data.
Resampling: balanced the dataset to prevent bias toward non-strike cases.
Model tuning: used XGBoost, which inherently optimizes learning rate, depth and regularization for better accuracy.
Model evaluation: implemented comprehensive metrics and visualization for deep insight.
Deployment: integrated the trained model into a real-time chatbot interface for end-user accessibility.
these techniques are relevant and clearly defined. they demonstrate how accuracy was improved and the ai model provides practical, data-driven stroke predictions.

Other features:Chatbot/ Softbot

The AI stroke sheild includes a fully functional chatbot interface that serves as the primary interaction 
point between the users and our AI system. This chatbot is highly relevant to our healthcare solution as it
enables accessible stroke risk assessment for both medical professionals and community members.

This chatbot is well-planned and appropriately set up with the following features:
Provide an intuitive web interface built with streamachine learningit for easy health data input
Guides users through entering key medical parameters (age, bmi, glucose level, smoking status, ect)
Delivers instant stroke risk predictions with clear probability scores
Offers visual feedback through progress bars and color-coded risk indicators (green for low risk, red for high risk)
Includes additional elements about stroke prediction and health monitoring

This chatbot successfully demonstrates how AI can interact with users in a healthcare context, making advanced medical
risk assessment accessible to non-experts while maintaining professional reliability. The feature is fully integrated 
with our trained XGboost model and follows the same data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring consistent and accurate 
predictions
