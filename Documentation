AI Solution - Relevance to the theme
The proposed ai stroke shield solution aligns with the theme of using artificial intelligence 
to improve healthcare within local communities. It applies machine learning to predict the 
likelihood of stroke based on medical and lifestyle data such as age, bmi, glucose levels and 
smoking habits. The system addresses challenges faced in many south african clinics where 
early diagnosis tools are limited, offering a proactive, data-driven method to identify high
risk patients before symptoms occur. By supporting early detection, efficient decision
making, and better resource allocation, the ai stroke shield solution enhances healthcare 
accessibility and directly contributes to improved community wellbeing making it both
relevant and impactful to the theme and environment described in the project brief.
