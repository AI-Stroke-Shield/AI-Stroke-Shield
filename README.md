## üìÅ Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from:  

üîó [Stroke Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data)

It includes health-related features such as **age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI**, etc., and indicates whether a stroke occurred.

## üß† Model Description

The project uses a **machine learning classifier** trained on patient health data to predict the likelihood of a stroke. Key points:  

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / [Specify your model]  
- **Input Features**: Age, Gender, Hypertension, Heart Disease, BMI, Smoking Status, etc.  
- **Output**: Probability of stroke (0‚Äì100%)  

The model is integrated with a **Streamlit web application** for easy interaction and visualization.
